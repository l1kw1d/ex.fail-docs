How do I check to see if I have new mail?
-----------------------------------------

To check for new mail, click **Refresh** from the toolbar. The contents of all system and user-defined folders are updated immediately.

[Back to top](#top)

How do I filter to see all unread messages?
-------------------------------------------

Messages within folders can be quickly sorted to show just the unread messages. Click the envelope icon at the top of the message column in the right-hand corner of the search bar to see just the unread messages.

![unread_messages.png](/hc/article_attachments/360054502113/unread_messages.png)

How do I adjust the Mail panes?
-------------------------------

1.  From the Mail tab, navigate to the bottom right-hand corner of the pane that you want to adjust.
2.  Click and hold the small triangle in the bottom right-hand corner.  
    ![Adjustable_pane.png](/hc/article_attachments/360053637674/Adjustable_pane.png)
3.  Drag to adjust.

How do I select multiple messages?
----------------------------------

1.  Access the Mail tab.
2.  Click the **Select** button at the top of the message list.
3.  Use the checkbox that appears beside each message to select or unselect.  
    _Note: The message details pane does not display information for multiple selections._
4.  Once you have all the messages that youâ€™d like selected, you can move the message into a folder, delete all, flag them or report them as Spam.

How do I mark one or more messages as spam?
-------------------------------------------

Clicking the **Spam** button results will move the message to the Spam folder, and it sends information to the spam filtering engine so that the filtering rules can be updated to catch future similar spam messages. This helps update webmail filtering and improves it to reflect the current trends of spammers.

_Note: Messages in the Spam folder are automatically deleted after 30 days._

To mark one or more messages as Spam:

1.  [Select the message(s)](#h_a07950f1-616b-4978-ae77-dc8a26bd2693) you would like to mark as Spam.
2.  Click the **Spam** button from the message list toolbar.
3.  The message is moved to your Spam folder.

[Back to top](#top)

What if the message is not spam?
--------------------------------

Legitimate emails can accidentally be tagged as spam. There are many reasons for this including, but not limited to, message subject, content, or message routing.

Any message that has been marked as spam and sent to your Spam folder will be deleted after 30 days. For this reason, it is good practice to review the contents of your Spam folder occasionally.

To mark one or more messages as not spam:

1.  [Select the message(s)](#h_a07950f1-616b-4978-ae77-dc8a26bd2693) you would like to mark as not spam.
2.  Click the **Not spam** button from the message list toolbar.

Marking a message as **Not spam** will both move the message to your Inbox, and it sends information to the spam-filtering engine so that the filtering rules can be updated to improve future recognition of valid emails similar to the one marked.

[Back to top](#top)

How do I manually mark one or more messages as read or unread?
--------------------------------------------------------------

1.  [Select the message(s)](#h_a07950f1-616b-4978-ae77-dc8a26bd2693) you would like to mark as read or unread.
2.  From the **Mark** drop-down list in the header, choose **As read** or **As unread**.  
    Alternatively, click the circle icon beside the message.

How do I flag messages?
-----------------------

If there are messages that you want to return to at a later time, you can flag them to make them easier to find later on. Flagged messages display in the column.

1.  [Select the message(s)](#h_a07950f1-616b-4978-ae77-dc8a26bd2693) you want to flag.
2.  From the **Mark** drop-down list in the header, choose **As flagged** or hover to the right of the message in the message list and click the flag icon when it comes available.

To remove the flag from one or more messages, select the messages, and from the **Mark** drop-down menu, choose **As unflagged**.

[Back to top](#top)

How do I delete messages?
-------------------------

1.  [Select the message(s)](#h_a07950f1-616b-4978-ae77-dc8a26bd2693) you would like to delete.  
    Alternatively, click a message to display its contents in the message details pane.
2.  Click the **Delete** button.
3.  When messages are deleted from the Inbox, Sent, Drafts or user-defined folders, they are temporarily moved to the Trash folder. When messages are deleted from the Trash folder, they are permanently deleted.

### How do I use Spellcheck?

Spellcheck is available in 44 different languages from the toolbar in the compose window. Use the drop-down list to choose the language that you want to apply.

1.  In the drop-down list, choose the language that you are using.  
    As you type, any questionable spelling is highlighted.
2.  When Spellcheck is active (indicated by the icon being lit up), left-click highlighted words to see a list of correctly spelled replacements.  
    Right-click to use your browser's built-in spellcheck function. If Spellcheck is active, you'll see both lists.
3.  Select the correct replacement option.
4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary.

### How do I insert an image in my message?

You can insert images in the body of your message, and you can specify the size of those images. Inserted images are referenced by their URL and may be any type of image file format, for example, .jpg, .gif, or .png. The referenced images can be located somewhere on the Internet, or they can be in your Files folders.

1.  Click the insert image icon from the text editor.
2.  Copy and paste in the URL of the source image into the source field or select the file selection option, and choose **Add file**.  
    ![insert_image.png](/hc/article_attachments/360037961714/insert_image.png)

    ![Attachment.png](/hc/article_attachments/360037961854/Attachment.png)

[Back to top](#top)

### Is there a limit to the size of the emails that I can send?

The maximum size for email messages, including any attachments, is 35 MB; however, when attachments are sent over the Internet, they must be MIME encoded, and this encoding increases the size of the message. Besides, some mail servers will not accept large email messages, so if you attach a large file to your message, it may not reach its intended recipient.

You should not try to send attachments that are larger than 27 MB. If you want to share large files, we recommend that you [store them in the Files section](https://help.opensrs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024758793#h_38568436-15b7-4cff-9b30-6abc82a8d132) and [share the file](https://help.opensrs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024758793#h_7439df9e-0f0f-414a-9727-50d285c92a92) rather than attaching it to an email.

Using Mail Folders to organize
------------------------------

### What are system Mail folders?

The system folders (Inbox, Drafts, Spam, Sent, and Trash) are permanent system folders that support basic email functions. You cannot add, rename or remove a system folder, though you can add sub-folders to any of the system folders.

[Back to top](#top)

### What are personal Mail folders?

Personal folders are the user-defined folders. You can create and name folders for the personal organization of mail messages up to a system defined limit. User-defined folders can be added, renamed, removed and emptied. You can add these folders at the top, or parent, level or as sub-folders. Sub-folders can also be added to other sub-folders.

Personal folders appear below the system folder list, after the Trash folder. Sub-folders that are added to system folders appear below their parent in the system folders list.

[Back to top](#top)

### How do I add a new folder?

1.  At the top of the folders list, select the **Menu** icon (three vertical dots)  and then click **Manage folders.  
    ****![Manage_folders.png](/hc/article_attachments/360037962174/Manage_folders.png)**
2.  Click **Create**.
3.  Type the name of the new folder in the **Folder name** field.
4.  If you want to add the new folder as a sub-folder of an existing folder, choose the folder from the **Parent folder** drop-down list.
5.  From the **List view mode** drop-down list, choose whether you want messages in the folder to be displayed as a list or as threads.  
    ![create_mail_folder.png](/hc/article_attachments/360037962234/create_mail_folder.png)
6.  Click **Save**.

The new folder appears under the systems folders list or as a sub-folder of a parent folder, depending on which option you choose.

[Back to top](#top)

### How do I sort messages within a folder?

When you look at a mail folder, the contents are displayed in date order from most recent to oldest. To sort messages within a folder by different criteria:

1.  Click the folder name in the Mail folder list.
2.  Select **Options** from the toolbar over the message list.
3.  Choose which sorting column you would like to useâ€”Arrival date, Sent date, Subject, From/To, From, To, CC, or Sizeâ€”and select if you would like it to be ascending or descending and if you would like conversations to be grouped by threads and then click **Save**.

[Back to top](#top)

### How can I find a specific message within a folder?

You can perform a case-insensitive search for characters or words that appear in the following areas of the message:

*   Subject: Search the Subject line of the message.
*   From: Search the From line of the message.
*   To: Search the To line of the message.
*   Cc: Search the Cc line of the message.
*   Bcc: Search the Bcc line of the message.
*   Body: Search the body of the message.
*   Entire message: Search the Sender, Subject, and Headers plus the body of the message.

_Note: We recommend that you do not use the entire message search as your primary search type. Depending on how many messages there are in the selected folder, a message search can take a long time, and your Webmail session could time out before the search completes._

To search within a selected folder:

1.  Select the folder you want to search in by clicking on it in the **Mail** folder list.
2.  In the search field, select the type of search from the drop-down list.
3.  Type your search criteria in the search field and then press Enter.
4.  Any messages matching the criteria are displayed.

To clear the search results, click the **X** in the corner of the search field.

[Back to top](#top)

### How do I rename, empty, or delete a folder?

1.  At the top of the folders list, choose the **Menu** icon (three vertical dots) and then click **Manage folders**
2.  Click the folder that you want to rename, empty, or delete.
3.  Do one of the following:

*   To rename the folder, enter the new name in the **Folder name** field, and click **Save**.
*   To empty the folder, select **Empty** from the toolbar and then **Delete** on the confirmation message.  
    _Note: These messages are still recoverable until you empty your Trash folder._
*   To delete the folder, select **Delete** from the toolbar and when the confirmation pop-up appears, select **Delete** again.  
    _Note: The folder is deleted, and the messages in that folder are moved to the Trash folder._

### How do I move one or more messages to another folder?

1.  [Select the message(s)](#h_a07950f1-616b-4978-ae77-dc8a26bd2693) that you would like to move.
2.  In the Mail header, click **More**, then click **Move to**, and select the folder to which you want to move the selected messages.
3.  Alternatively, after selecting the messages, press and hold the left mouse button and slide your cursor to the folder to which you want to move the messages, and then release the mouse button.

[Back to top](#top)

### How do I set up Webmail to automatically move messages to folders?

Webmail allows you to [use filters to sort and order incoming mail](https://help.opensrs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024758893#h_aa07b11d-b615-4525-bb16-6fe744c21137). Mail can be identified using a combination of criteria and conditions to trigger one of three actions:

*   Forward message to
*   Move to folder
*   Delete email message
</HTML>
