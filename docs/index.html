<h2>General</h2>
<h3>What browsers can I use to view my mail?</h3>
<p>Webmail supports the following browsers:<br>
● Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.0 and higher<br>
● Mozilla Firefox 2.0 and higher<br>
● Chrome 1.0 and higher<br>
● Safari 3.2 and higher<br>
● Konqueror 3.5 and higher<br>
<em>Note: You may be able to view the Webmail interface on other, unsupported browsers; however,<br>
some features may produce unexpected results.</em></p>
<h3>What makes up the Webmail application?</h3>
<p>Webmail is comprised of the following components: ​ <strong>Mail</strong> ​, ​ <strong>Contacts</strong> ​, ​ <strong>Files</strong> ​, ​ <strong>Calendar</strong> ​, ​ <strong>RSS</strong><br>
(optional), ​ <strong>Admin</strong> ​ (on applicable accounts), and ​ <strong>Settings</strong> ​. Each part is tied together with the<br>
sidebar and contains a work area.<br>
Back to top</p>
<h4>Navigating Webmail using the sidebar</h4>
<p>The sidebar in webmail is available on the left-hand side of the window no matter which<br>
component that you’re currently viewing. The sidebar includes:<br>
● Access to the six Webmail components<br>
● Quick access to compose new messages<br>
● Admin access depending on your account<br>
● Help access<br>
● A Logout button</p>
<h4>Work Area</h4>
<p>Each Webmail component is divided into two or three work areas which are designed to take<br>
advantage of a wide-screen view. These sections automatically hide as you shrink the web</p>
<p>browser down in size but is still accessible by a toggle at the top of the visible pane.<br>
Back to top</p>
<h2>Mail</h2>
<h3>What are the Mail features?</h3>
<p>As the default view, the ​ <strong>Mail</strong> ​ tab provides you with access to essential email functions. It has<br>
three main panes, including the Mail folders list, message list and message preview.</p>
<h3>How do I check to see if I have new mail?</h3>
<p>To check for new mail, click ​ <strong>Refresh</strong> ​ from the toolbar. The contents of all system and<br>
user-defined folders are updated immediately.<br>
Back to top</p>
<h3>How do I select multiple messages?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Access the Mail tab.</li>
<li>Click the ​ <strong>Select</strong> ​ button at the top of the message list.</li>
<li>Use the checkbox that appears beside each message to select or unselect.<br>
<em>Note: The message details pane does not display information for multiple selections.</em></li>
<li>Once you have all the messages that you’d like selected, you can move the message<br>
into a folder, delete all, flag them or report them as Spam.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How do I mark one or more messages as spam?</h3>
<p>Clicking the ​ <strong>Spam</strong> ​ button results will move the message to the Spam folder, and it sends<br>
information to the spam filtering engine so that the filtering rules can be updated to catch future<br>
similar spam messages. This helps update webmail filtering and improves it to reflect the current<br>
trends of spammers.<br>
<em>Note: Messages in the Spam folder are automatically deleted after 30 days.</em><br>
To mark one or more messages as Spam:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the message(s)​ you would like to mark as Spam.</li>
<li>Click the ​ <strong>Spam</strong> ​ button from the message list toolbar.</li>
<li>The message is moved to your Spam folder.<br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h3>What if the message is not spam?</h3>
<p>Legitimate emails can accidentally be tagged as spam. There are many reasons for this<br>
including, but not limited to, message subject, content, or message routing.<br>
Any message that has been marked as spam and sent to your Spam folder will be deleted after<br>
30 days. For this reason, it is good practice to review the contents of your Spam folder<br>
occasionally.<br>
To mark one or more messages as not spam:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the message(s)​ you would like to mark as not spam.</li>
<li>Click the ​ <strong>Not spam</strong> ​ button from the message list toolbar.<br>
Marking a message as ​ <strong>Not spam</strong> ​ will both move the message to your Inbox, and it sends<br>
information to the spam-filtering engine so that the filtering rules can be updated to improve<br>
future recognition of valid emails similar to the one marked.<br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h3>How do I manually mark one or more messages as read or unread?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select the message(s)​ you would like to mark as read or unread.</li>
<li>From the ​ <strong>Mark</strong> ​ drop-down list in the header, choose ​ <strong>As read</strong> ​ or ​ <strong>As unread</strong> ​.<br>
Alternatively, click the circle icon beside the message.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How do I flag messages?</h3>
<p>If there are messages that you want to return to at a later time, you can flag them to make them<br>
easier to find later on. Flagged messages display in the column.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the message(s)​ you want to flag.</li>
<li>From the ​ <strong>Mark</strong> ​ drop-down list in the header, choose ​ <strong>As flagged</strong> ​ or hover to the right of<br>
the message in the message list and click the flag icon when it comes available.<br>
To remove the flag from one or more messages, select the messages, and from the ​ <strong>Mark</strong><br>
drop-down menu, choose ​ <strong>As unflagged</strong> ​.<br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h3>How do I delete messages?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select the message(s)​ you would like to delete.<br>
Alternatively, click a message to display its contents in the message details pane.</li>
<li>Click the ​ <strong>Delete</strong> ​ button.</li>
<li>When messages are deleted from the Inbox, Sent, Drafts or user-defined folders, they<br>
are temporarily moved to the Trash folder. When messages are deleted from the Trash<br>
folder, they are permanently deleted.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Composing messages</h3>

<strong>Followup-to</strong> ​ field.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Note: ​ Reply-to ​ sets a different email address that recipients will send replies to when</h5>

<h4>How do I use Spellcheck?</h4>
<p>Spellcheck is available in 44 different languages from the toolbar in the compose window. Use<br>
the drop-down list to choose the language that you want to apply.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the drop-down list, choose the language that you are using.<br>
As you type, any questionable spelling is highlighted.</li>
<li>When Spellcheck is active (indicated by the icon being lit up), left-click highlighted words<br>
to see a list of correctly spelled replacements.<br>
Right-click to use your browser's built-in spellcheck function. If Spellcheck is active, you'll<br>
see both lists.</li>
<li>Select the correct replacement option.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary.</li>
</ol>
<h4>How do I insert an image in my message?</h4>
<p>You can insert images in the body of your message, and you can specify the size of those<br>
images. Inserted images are referenced by their URL and may be any type of image file format,<br>
for example, .jpg, .gif, or .png. The referenced images can be located somewhere on the<br>
Internet, or they can be in your Files folders.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the insert image icon from the text editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy and paste in the URL of the source image into the source field or select the file<br>
selection option, and choose ​ <strong>Add file</strong> ​.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjust the dimensions as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click ​ <strong>Ok</strong> ​.<br>
Back to top</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>How do I attach a file to a message?</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the ​ <strong>Attach</strong> ​ button from the top toolbar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Browse to the file you want to attach and click ​ <strong>Open</strong> ​.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attachment will appear in the Options and attachments pane once uploaded.<br>
Back to top</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Is there a limit to the size of the emails that I can send?</h4>
<p>The maximum size for email messages, including any attachments, is 35 MB; however, when<br>
attachments are sent over the Internet, they must be MIME encoded, and this encoding<br>
increases the size of the message. Besides, some mail servers will not accept large email<br>
messages, so if you attach a large file to your message, it may not reach its intended recipient.<br>
You should not try to send attachments that are larger than 27 MB. If you want to share large<br>
files, we recommend that you ​store them in the Files section​ and ​share the file​ rather than<br>
attaching it to an email.</p>
<h3>Using Mail Folders to organize</h3>
<h4>What are system Mail folders?</h4>
<p>The system folders (Inbox, Drafts, Spam, Sent, and Trash) are permanent system folders that<br>
support basic email functions. You cannot add, rename or remove a system folder, though you<br>
can add sub-folders to any of the system folders.<br>
Back to top</p>
<h4>What are personal Mail folders?</h4>
<p>Personal folders are the user-defined folders. You can create and name folders for the personal<br>
organization of mail messages up to a system defined limit. User-defined folders can be added,<br>
renamed, removed and emptied. You can add these folders at the top, or parent, level or as<br>
sub-folders. Sub-folders can also be added to other sub-folders.<br>
Personal folders appear below the system folder list, after the Trash folder. Sub-folders that are<br>
added to system folders appear below their parent in the system folders list.<br>
Back to top</p>
<h4>How do I add a new folder?</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the top of the folders list, select the ​ <strong>Menu</strong> ​ icon (three vertical dots) and then click<br>
<strong>Manage folders.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click ​ <strong>Create</strong> ​.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type the name of the new folder in the ​ <strong>Folder name</strong> ​ field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to add the new folder as a sub-folder of an existing folder, choose the folder<br>
from the ​ <strong>Parent folder</strong> ​ drop-down list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the ​ <strong>List view mode</strong> ​ drop-down list, choose whether you want messages in the<br>
folder to be displayed as a list or as threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click ​ <strong>Save</strong> ​.<br>
The new folder appears under the systems folders list or as a sub-folder of a parent folder,<br>
depending on which option you choose.<br>
Back to top</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>How do I sort messages within a folder?</h4>
<p>When you look at a mail folder, the contents are displayed in date order from most recent to<br>
oldest. To sort messages within a folder by different criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the folder name in the Mail folder list.</li>
<li>Select ​ <strong>Options</strong> ​ from the toolbar over the message list.</li>
<li>Choose which sorting column you would like to use—Arrival date, Sent date, Subject,<br>
From/To, From, To, CC, or Size—and select if you would like it to be ascending or<br>
descending and if you would like conversations to be grouped by threads and then click</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Save</strong> ​.<br>
Back to top</p>
<h4>How can I find a specific message within a folder?</h4>
<p>You can perform a case-insensitive search for characters or words that appear in the following<br>
areas of the message:<br>
● Subject: Search the Subject line of the message.<br>
● From: Search the From line of the message.<br>
● To: Search the To line of the message.<br>
● Cc: Search the Cc line of the message.<br>
● Bcc: Search the Bcc line of the message.<br>
● Body: Search the body of the message.<br>
● Entire message: Search the Sender, Subject, and Headers plus the body of the<br>
message.<br>
<em>Note: We recommend that you do not use the entire message search as your primary search<br>
type. Depending on how many messages there are in the selected folder, a message search<br>
can take a long time, and your Webmail session could time out before the search completes.</em><br>
To search within a selected folder:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the folder you want to search in by clicking on it in the ​ <strong>Mail</strong> ​ folder list.</li>
<li>In the search field, select the type of search from the drop-down list.</li>
<li>Type your search criteria in the search field and then press Enter.</li>
<li>Any messages matching the criteria are displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p>To clear the search results, click the ​ <strong>X</strong> ​ in the corner of the search field.<br>
Back to top</p>
<h4>How do I rename, empty, or delete a folder?</h4>
<ol>
<li>At the top of the folders list, choose the ​ <strong>Menu</strong> ​ icon (three vertical dots) and then click<br>
<strong>Manage folders</strong></li>
<li>Click the folder that you want to rename, empty, or delete.</li>
<li>Do one of the following:<br>
○ To rename the folder, enter the new name in the ​ <strong>Folder name</strong> ​ field, and click<br>
<strong>Save</strong> ​.<br>
○ To empty the folder, select ​ <strong>Empty</strong> ​ from the toolbar​ ​and then ​ <strong>Delete</strong> ​ on the<br>
confirmation message.<br>
<em>Note: These messages are still recoverable until you empty your Trash folder.</em><br>
○ To delete the folder, select ​ <strong>Delete</strong> ​ from the toolbar and when the confirmation<br>
pop-up appears, select ​ <strong>Delete</strong> ​ again.<br>
<em>Note: The folder is deleted, and the messages in that folder are moved to the</em><br>
<em>Trash folder.</em></li>
</ol>
<h4>How do I move one or more messages to another folder?</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the message(s)​ that you would like to move.</li>
<li>In the Mail header, click ​ <strong>More</strong> ​, then click ​ <strong>Move to</strong> ​, and select the folder to which you<br>
want to move the selected messages.</li>
<li>Alternatively, after selecting the messages, press and hold the left mouse button and<br>
slide your cursor to the folder to which you want to move the messages, and then<br>
release the mouse button.<br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h4>How do I set up Webmail to automatically move messages to folders?</h4>
<p>Webmail allows you to ​use filters to sort and order incoming mail​. Mail can be identified using a<br>
combination of criteria and conditions to trigger one of three actions:<br>
● Forward message to<br>
● Move to folder<br>
● Delete email message</p>
<h2>Contacts</h2>
<h3>What is the Contacts tab?</h3>
<p>The ​ <strong>Contacts</strong> ​ tab is where you add, group, manage and delete contact information. Contacts<br>
supports drag-and-drop so you can quickly move contacts to groups. You can also address<br>
messages to one or more contacts from within the Contacts pane. The Contacts tab is divided<br>
into three panes: groups, contacts list, and contact details.<br>
Back to top</p>
<h3>How do I add a contact?</h3>
<p>You can add contacts from the Contacts tab or directly from your email.<br>
To add a contact in the Contacts tab:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click ​ <strong>Contacts</strong> ​ from the sidebar.</li>
<li>Select ​ <strong>Create</strong> ​ from the top toolbar.</li>
<li>Fill in the contact information in the blank contact card that appears in the details pane.</li>
<li>Click ​ <strong>Save</strong> ​.<br>
To add a contact from your email:</li>
<li>Select an email from the person that you would like to add.</li>
<li>In the email details, click on the email address in the header.</li>
<li>From the options, select ​ <strong>Add to address book</strong> ​.</li>
<li>The email will be automatically added to your address book.<br>
Once the contact is created, you can display the contact and then click the ​ <strong>Groups</strong> ​ tab to<br>
assign the contact to one or more groups. Toggle on the groups where you want to add this<br>
contact. All contacts belong to the Contacts group by default, but they can be added to as many<br>
other groups as you’d like.<br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h3>How do I select multiple contacts?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Access the contact list.</li>
<li>Click the ​ <strong>Select</strong> ​ button at the top of the contact list.</li>
<li>Use the checkbox that appears beside each contact to select or unselect.<br>
<em>Note: The contact details pane does not display information for multiple selections.</em></li>
<li>Move the contacts into a group for future use, or select ​ <strong>Compose</strong> ​ from the sidebar to<br>
start an email to the selected contacts.<br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h3>How do I search for contacts?</h3>
<p>The basic search located at the top of the contact list uses display name, email, first name, last<br>
name and all fields. If you want to do an advanced search,</p>
<ol>
<li>Click ​ <strong>Contacts</strong> ​.</li>
<li>Select ​ <strong>Search</strong> ​ from the toolbar.</li>
<li>In the ​ <strong>Advanced search</strong> ​ pop-up, complete as many fields as you can to narrow your<br>
search. Advanced search will allow you to search by any of the contact card fields and<br>
any information entered in the search will remain if you need to change between the<br>
tabs.</li>
<li>Click ​ <strong>Search</strong> ​ and the contacts that match your search criteria display in the Contacts list<br>
pane.<br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using groups in Contacts</h3>
<h4>How do I create a group?</h4>
<p>Groups are an excellent way to create a list of commonly emailed contacts for quick access and<br>
easy addressing. The Groups list displays alphabetically, and contacts can be added to multiple<br>
groups at once.</p>
<ol>
<li>At the top of the Groups pane, click the three vertical dots icon to access the menu.</li>
<li>Select ​ <strong>Add group</strong> ​.</li>
<li>In the pop-up, type the name of the new group in the text field.</li>
<li>Click ​ <strong>Save</strong> ​.<br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h4>How do I add one or more contacts to a group?</h4>
<p>You can add contacts to a group by displaying the contact, and then selecting the group to<br>
which you want to assign the contact, or you can select one or more contacts and drag the<br>
contacts to the group.<br>
● Dragging a contact from one group to another will result in a copy being placed in the<br>
new group.<br>
● You can drag the same contact to multiple groups.<br>
● You can drag multiple contacts at the same time.<br>
To add one or more contacts to a group:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access the Contacts list.</li>
<li>Click ​ <strong>Select</strong> ​ and select the contacts that you would like to add to a group.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the contacts onto the group or click ​ <strong>More</strong> ​ and ​ <strong>Assign to group.</strong><br>
Back to top</li>
</ol>
<h4>How do I remove contacts from a group?</h4>

<h3>What are Mail filters?</h3>
<p>A filter is a set of conditions that you define to handle incoming email automatically. You can set<br>
filters to sort incoming email to various folders, delete unwanted messages, or forward<br>
messages to other email accounts. The action you prepare is triggered when the rules you<br>
create are found to be true.<br>
Webmail can analyze the following fields in the message header: Subject, From, To, size, and a<br>
wildcard that you can define.<br>
The fields can be evaluated according to the following conditions: Does or does not contain, is<br>
or is not equal to, does or does not exist and does or does not match expression. You define the<br>
value of the condition.</p>
<h4>What is plus sign tagging and how do I use it with filters?</h4>
<p>Plus sign tagging allows you to identify and filter incoming email according to a tag that you add<br>
to your email address when you give your email address to an individual, a group, or a<br>
business.<br>
To use plus sign tagging, you just enhance your email address by adding a plus sign (+) after<br>
your name—but before the @ symbol—followed by some identifying text. You can set up<br>
filtering rules that recognize incoming mail that is sent to the tagged address and move it to a<br>
specific folder.<br>
By using the plus tagging feature, you will also know whether your email address has been sold<br>
to a third party. If you start receiving unwanted or spam email that is addressed to your plus sign<br>
tagged email address, you will know that your email address was sold, and you can easily<br>
create a filtering rule that deletes any future email that is sent to that tagged address.<br>

<h3>How do I set an allowed or blocked senders list?</h3>
<p>The allowed and blocked senders lists let you create a list of senders that will either be<br>
automatically allowed and bypass your spam filter or be automatically blocked from being<br>
received into your inbox.<br>
Addresses that are in your Contacts are considered to be in your allowed senders list even<br>
though the contact entries are not displayed in the allowed senders list. If you add an address to<br>
the blocked senders list that is also in your Contacts, the address will be blocked as the blocked<br>
senders list takes precedence over your Contacts.<br>
The allowed and blocked senders list uses the star (*) as a wildcard which lets you set up to<br>
block or allow any emails from a specific domain. These should be used with caution as you<br>
may accidentally block every email sent from *@gmail.com for example.<br>
You can add up to 1,000 entries each in the allowed and blocked list.<br>
To adjust the allowed or blocked senders list</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Settings tab, click ​ <strong>Spam settings</strong> ​.</li>
<li>Add or remove the email address on a separate line to the ​ <strong>Allowed senders</strong> ​ list or<br>
the ​ <strong>Blocked senders</strong> ​ list text field.<br>
<em>Note: If you want to block an entire domain, use the star (*) to denote a wildcard</em><br>
<em>before the at (@) symbol.</em></li>
<li>Select ​ <strong>Save</strong> ​ when you’re done.<br>

<h2>Admin</h2>
<h3>What is the Admin component?</h3>
<p>The ​ <strong>Admin</strong> ​ component allows domain administrators to administer email accounts. They can<br>
perform common administrative tasks for email, such as resetting passwords, creating, deleting,<br>
and modifying users. Domain administrators can also add/remove workgroups and workgroup<br>
administrators and manage and brand their domain.<br>
