## General

### What browsers can I use to view my mail?

Webmail supports the following browsers:
● Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.0 and higher
● Mozilla Firefox 2.0 and higher
● Chrome 1.0 and higher
● Safari 3.2 and higher
● Konqueror 3.5 and higher
_Note: You may be able to view the Webmail interface on other, unsupported browsers; however,
some features may produce unexpected results._

### What makes up the Webmail application?

Webmail is comprised of the following components: ​ **Mail** ​, ​ **Contacts** ​, ​ **Files** ​, ​ **Calendar** ​, ​ **RSS**
(optional), ​ **Admin** ​ (on applicable accounts), and ​ **Settings** ​. Each part is tied together with the
sidebar and contains a work area.
Back to top

#### Navigating Webmail using the sidebar

The sidebar in webmail is available on the left-hand side of the window no matter which
component that you’re currently viewing. The sidebar includes:
● Access to the six Webmail components
● Quick access to compose new messages
● Admin access depending on your account
● Help access
● A Logout button

#### Work Area

Each Webmail component is divided into two or three work areas which are designed to take
advantage of a wide-screen view. These sections automatically hide as you shrink the web


browser down in size but is still accessible by a toggle at the top of the visible pane.
Back to top


## Mail

### What are the Mail features?

As the default view, the ​ **Mail** ​ tab provides you with access to essential email functions. It has
three main panes, including the Mail folders list, message list and message preview.

### How do I check to see if I have new mail?

To check for new mail, click ​ **Refresh** ​ from the toolbar. The contents of all system and
user-defined folders are updated immediately.
Back to top

### How do I select multiple messages?

1. Access the Mail tab.
2. Click the ​ **Select** ​ button at the top of the message list.
3. Use the checkbox that appears beside each message to select or unselect.
    _Note: The message details pane does not display information for multiple selections._
4. Once you have all the messages that you’d like selected, you can move the message
    into a folder, delete all, flag them or report them as Spam.

### How do I mark one or more messages as spam?

Clicking the ​ **Spam** ​ button results will move the message to the Spam folder, and it sends
information to the spam filtering engine so that the filtering rules can be updated to catch future
similar spam messages. This helps update webmail filtering and improves it to reflect the current
trends of spammers.
_Note: Messages in the Spam folder are automatically deleted after 30 days._
To mark one or more messages as Spam:

1. Select the message(s)​ you would like to mark as Spam.
2. Click the ​ **Spam** ​ button from the message list toolbar.
3. The message is moved to your Spam folder.
Back to top


### What if the message is not spam?

Legitimate emails can accidentally be tagged as spam. There are many reasons for this
including, but not limited to, message subject, content, or message routing.
Any message that has been marked as spam and sent to your Spam folder will be deleted after
30 days. For this reason, it is good practice to review the contents of your Spam folder
occasionally.
To mark one or more messages as not spam:

1. Select the message(s)​ you would like to mark as not spam.
2. Click the ​ **Not spam** ​ button from the message list toolbar.
Marking a message as ​ **Not spam** ​ will both move the message to your Inbox, and it sends
information to the spam-filtering engine so that the filtering rules can be updated to improve
future recognition of valid emails similar to the one marked.
Back to top

### How do I manually mark one or more messages as read or unread?

1. Select the message(s)​ you would like to mark as read or unread.
2. From the ​ **Mark** ​ drop-down list in the header, choose ​ **As read** ​ or ​ **As unread** ​.
    Alternatively, click the circle icon beside the message.

### How do I flag messages?

If there are messages that you want to return to at a later time, you can flag them to make them
easier to find later on. Flagged messages display in the column.

1. Select the message(s)​ you want to flag.
2. From the ​ **Mark** ​ drop-down list in the header, choose ​ **As flagged** ​ or hover to the right of
    the message in the message list and click the flag icon when it comes available.
To remove the flag from one or more messages, select the messages, and from the ​ **Mark**
drop-down menu, choose ​ **As unflagged** ​.
Back to top


### How do I delete messages?

1. Select the message(s)​ you would like to delete.
    Alternatively, click a message to display its contents in the message details pane.

    are temporarily moved to the Trash folder. When messages are deleted from the Trash
    folder, they are permanently deleted.

#### How do I compose and send a new message?

2. Address your email using the ​ **To** ​ field.
3. Click the ​ **Plus** ​ icon at the end of the ​ **To** ​ field to add the option of a ​ **Cc** ​, ​ **Bcc** ​, ​ **Reply-to** ​ or
    **Followup-to** ​ field.

##### Note: ​ Reply-to ​ sets a different email address that recipients will send replies to when

##### they select reply. ​ Followup-to ​ is useful when posting to mailing lists so that replies are

```
sent to the list address but not to your personal address.
```
4. Type the subject in the ​ **Subject** ​ field.
5. Compose your message and attach any attachments in the message field.
6. Click ​ **Send** ​ in the bottom left-hand corner of the message window.
Back to top

    As you type, any questionable spelling is highlighted.

    see both lists.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as necessary.

#### How do I insert an image in my message?

You can insert images in the body of your message, and you can specify the size of those
images. Inserted images are referenced by their URL and may be any type of image file format,
for example, .jpg, .gif, or .png. The referenced images can be located somewhere on the
Internet, or they can be in your Files folders.

1. Click the insert image icon from the text editor.


2. Copy and paste in the URL of the source image into the source field or select the file
    selection option, and choose ​ **Add file** ​.
3. Adjust the dimensions as needed.
4. Click ​ **Ok** ​.
Back to top

#### How do I attach a file to a message?

1. Click the ​ **Attach** ​ button from the top toolbar.
2. Browse to the file you want to attach and click ​ **Open** ​.


3. The attachment will appear in the Options and attachments pane once uploaded.
Back to top

#### Is there a limit to the size of the emails that I can send?

The maximum size for email messages, including any attachments, is 35 MB; however, when
attachments are sent over the Internet, they must be MIME encoded, and this encoding
increases the size of the message. Besides, some mail servers will not accept large email
messages, so if you attach a large file to your message, it may not reach its intended recipient.
You should not try to send attachments that are larger than 27 MB. If you want to share large
files, we recommend that you ​store them in the Files section​ and ​share the file​ rather than
attaching it to an email.

### Using Mail Folders to organize

#### What are system Mail folders?

The system folders (Inbox, Drafts, Spam, Sent, and Trash) are permanent system folders that
support basic email functions. You cannot add, rename or remove a system folder, though you
can add sub-folders to any of the system folders.
Back to top


#### What are personal Mail folders?

Personal folders are the user-defined folders. You can create and name folders for the personal
organization of mail messages up to a system defined limit. User-defined folders can be added,
renamed, removed and emptied. You can add these folders at the top, or parent, level or as
sub-folders. Sub-folders can also be added to other sub-folders.
Personal folders appear below the system folder list, after the Trash folder. Sub-folders that are
added to system folders appear below their parent in the system folders list.
Back to top

#### How do I add a new folder?

1. At the top of the folders list, select the ​ **Menu** ​ icon (three vertical dots) and then click
    **Manage folders.**
2. Click ​ **Create** ​.
3. Type the name of the new folder in the ​ **Folder name** ​ field.
4. If you want to add the new folder as a sub-folder of an existing folder, choose the folder
    from the ​ **Parent folder** ​ drop-down list.


5. From the ​ **List view mode** ​ drop-down list, choose whether you want messages in the
    folder to be displayed as a list or as threads.
6. Click ​ **Save** ​.
The new folder appears under the systems folders list or as a sub-folder of a parent folder,
depending on which option you choose.
Back to top

#### How do I sort messages within a folder?

oldest. To sort messages within a folder by different criteria:

1. Click the folder name in the Mail folder list.
2. Select ​ **Options** ​ from the toolbar over the message list.
3. Choose which sorting column you would like to use—Arrival date, Sent date, Subject,
    From/To, From, To, CC, or Size—and select if you would like it to be ascending or
    descending and if you would like conversations to be grouped by threads and then click


**Save** ​.
Back to top

#### How can I find a specific message within a folder?

You can perform a case-insensitive search for characters or words that appear in the following

can take a long time, and your Webmail session could time out before the search completes._

1. Select the folder you want to search in by clicking on it in the ​ **Mail** ​ folder list.
2. In the search field, select the type of search from the drop-down list.

       pop-up appears, select ​ **Delete** ​ again.
       _Note: The folder is deleted, and the messages in that folder are moved to the_

Back to top

#### How do I set up Webmail to automatically move messages to folders?

Webmail allows you to ​use filters to sort and order incoming mail​. Mail can be identified using a
combination of criteria and conditions to trigger one of three actions:
● Forward message to

### What are Mail filters?

A filter is a set of conditions that you define to handle incoming email automatically. You can set
filters to sort incoming email to various folders, delete unwanted messages, or forward
messages to other email accounts. The action you prepare is triggered when the rules you
create are found to be true.
Webmail can analyze the following fields in the message header: Subject, From, To, size, and a
wildcard that you can define.
The fields can be evaluated according to the following conditions: Does or does not contain, is
or is not equal to, does or does not exist and does or does not match expression. You define the
value of the condition.

#### What is plus sign tagging and how do I use it with filters?

Plus sign tagging allows you to identify and filter incoming email according to a tag that you add
to your email address when you give your email address to an individual, a group, or a
business.
To use plus sign tagging, you just enhance your email address by adding a plus sign (+) after
your name—but before the @ symbol—followed by some identifying text. You can set up
filtering rules that recognize incoming mail that is sent to the tagged address and move it to a
specific folder.
By using the plus tagging feature, you will also know whether your email address has been sold
to a third party. If you start receiving unwanted or spam email that is addressed to your plus sign
tagged email address, you will know that your email address was sold, and you can easily
create a filtering rule that deletes any future email that is sent to that tagged address.

### How do I set an allowed or blocked senders list?

The allowed and blocked senders lists let you create a list of senders that will either be
automatically allowed and bypass your spam filter or be automatically blocked from being
received into your inbox.
Addresses that are in your Contacts are considered to be in your allowed senders list even
though the contact entries are not displayed in the allowed senders list. If you add an address to
the blocked senders list that is also in your Contacts, the address will be blocked as the blocked
senders list takes precedence over your Contacts.
The allowed and blocked senders list uses the star (*) as a wildcard which lets you set up to
block or allow any emails from a specific domain. These should be used with caution as you
may accidentally block every email sent from *@gmail.com for example.
You can add up to 1,000 entries each in the allowed and blocked list.
To adjust the allowed or blocked senders list

1. In the Settings tab, click ​ **Spam settings** ​.
2. Add or remove the email address on a separate line to the ​ **Allowed senders** ​ list or
    the ​ **Blocked senders** ​ list text field.
    _Note: If you want to block an entire domain, use the star (*) to denote a wildcard_
    _before the at (@) symbol._
3. Select ​ **Save** ​ when you’re done.
